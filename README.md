# GCP-DevOps-Project

This project demonstrates a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for a React portfolio website using Google Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, and Kubernetes Engine (GKE). When code is pushed to the main branch of a GitHub repository, the pipeline automatically builds the Docker image, pushes it to the Artifact Registry, and deploys the application to a GKE cluster.
